# Restaurant Website Landing Page
**Version 1.0.0**

A static landing page restaurant website for restaurant owners to attract more customers to come to thier place and have a nice meal.

## The challenge why the project was built

There are a couple of restaurants in our area where they don't have a website so customers can see what type of dishes they have on their menu.
That's why I take into account to search the internet for some PSD designs of restaurants and convert them into HTML and CSS.

## Languages and Technologies Used in the project
1. HTML5
2. CSS3 and SASS
3. Adobe Photoshop
4. Sublime Text

## How you can contribute to the project?
1. Clone the project on your local machine with a version control such as Git, SourceTree, or GitKraken.
2. After you have the project set up on your machine, next is thing to do is to set up your code editor such as Sublime, Visual Studio Code, or Brackets to install SASS.
You can check out the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install) on how to install the language in your local machine.
